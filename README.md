# Dal-makhni
Dal makhani or dal makhni is a dish originating from the Punjab region of India. The primary ingredients are whole black lentils, red kidney beans, butter and cream. The dish gets its richness from the use of cream or butter, but it can also be prepared with yogurt, milk or no dairy. 
Creamy and buttery Dal Makhani is one of India’s most loved dal!

Lentils have been an integral part of my diet. In India, we pretty much eat lentils everyday and in my house especially there was never a day when there was no dal on the table.

The most common dal that mom used to make every day was obviously the arhar/toor dal (split pigeon pea lentil). Then there was masoor dal (red lentils), chana dal and moong dal which she also made once in a while.

But one dal that was made only on special occasions was Dal Makhani.

Makhani means “buttery”, so for this recipe whole black lentils (urad sabut) is cooked with lot of butter and cream. Along with urad sabut,  rajma (kidney beans) are also often added to this dal
