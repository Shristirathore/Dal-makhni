Hey foodie !!!Shristi welcome you here...Kindly read all the tips to make a restaurant style dal makhni ..... 



1. Simmer on low heat for long time- you will get the best flavors of this dal, if you let it simmer for hours on low heat. I understand that we all have busy lives, but if you can, I high recommend simmering the dal for 30 minutes at least. An hour or two is even better.

Slow cooking enhances all the flavors and makes the dal super delicious and creamy. A lot of restaurants who are known for their amazing dal makhani actually simmer it the whole day.

Basically you boil the lentils till they are soft and then you proceed to make the masala and all this while the lentils will keep simmering on medium-low flame.

Then you add the dal to the masala and let the dal simmer some more. For this recipe, the dal was simmered for around 1 hour & 15 minutes on low heat.

2. Be generous with using butter and cream- this is not a recipe to cut down on the fat. The butter and cream are essential for that dal makhani flavor that you love.

So don’t add only 1 tablespoon of cream and butter if you want that restaurant style taste.

3. Less is more when it comes to using spices in dal makhani- over the years I have tried so many combinations. And finally I have come to this conclusion that dal makhani doesn’t really need any spice!

I have added 1/4 teaspoon of garam masala but that’s also optional. You can skip it. Other than that there’s only 1/2 teaspoon of kashmiri red chili powder for the color mainly.

No kasuri methi, cumin seeds nothing.

The main flavors of the dal come from using fresh onion, ginger, garlic, tomato puree and liberal amount of butter and ghee. That’s all you need to make a good dal makhani.

4. Use white onion for that sweet and subtle flavor, red onion has a strong flavor which effects the final taste of the dal.

5. Use store bought tomato puree for that smooth texture- if you are looking for that creamy texture, then do use store bought tomato puree.

If you use regular pureed tomatoes, make sure to add some tomato paste.

Since tomato paste is concentrated, it gives a really nice rich flavor.

6. Pinch of sugar helps in balancing the flavors– I add only 1/2 teaspoon of sugar but it really helps in giving the dal that extra flavor.

7. Serve with a pat of salted amul butter- if possible use it even while cooking the dal! It makes a difference guys. I cooked this entire dal using Amul salted butter.

For those who don’t know Amul is an Indian brand whose butter is what most people in India use all the time.

And even if you can’t use it while cooking, don’t forget to serve the dal with a piece of amul butter. You will notice the difference! And if you can’t find amul butter at all, I will suggest using salted butter anyway.

8. Infuse smokey flavor to the dal through dhungar method- just like Dal Tadka, I like infusing my dal makhani with the smokey flavor too. It does make a difference.

I only smoke it for 2 minutes in case of dal makhani. It doesn’t need to very smokey.

However if you can’t find a charcoal, you can skip this step.
